# Portfolio-Optimisation-via-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

This is a notebook that implement portfolio optimisation using Monte Carlo simulation for learning proposes

It is a replication of the notebook(https://github.com/aldodec/Monte-Carlo-Portfolio-Allocation), and I have made improvements as part of the learning process.

Some of the packages have been changed and the notebook by the original poster cannot be ran properly. I have fixed these and viewer can run the notebook and learn to implement an optimisation of portfolio via Monte Carlo simulation.
